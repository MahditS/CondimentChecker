### Condiment Inventory Tracker

This computer vision program can detect three types of condiments from my fridge: Ketchup, BBQ Sauce, and Siracha! Ever wondered what condiments you need to buy when out on a shopping trip? This program can be used to keep track of what's in your fridge, and potentially automate ordering processes for restaurants. The sky is the limit!
